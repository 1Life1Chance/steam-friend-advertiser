# Steam Friend Advertiser

This tool is designed to send a message to everyone on your steam friends list whether they are online or not. The idea was to mimic the announcement functionality of steam groups... without the group part of course.
Note: You can be logged in on the steam client and run this bot concurrently (You will see the messages pop up on the client as the bot runs).
#Installation & Usage

1. npm install
2. node bot.js
3. Enter your credentials (2FA is also supported)
4. Enter your message
5. Let 'er rip

# Other Notes

You can change the delay by editing line 43, or you can comment it out. Do so at your own risk.
